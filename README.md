# SpaceApps-Eclipse
Eclipses are awe-inspiring celestial events that drastically change the appearance of one of the two biggest objects we see in our sky: our Sun and Moon. On Earth, people can experience eclipses when Earth, the Moon, and the Sun align. In this repository, we explain how and why eclipses occur, and why only some people on Earth can see an eclipse at a given time.
